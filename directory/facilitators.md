# Facilitators

Payment verification and settlement services for x402. A facilitator verifies payment signatures and settles USDC on-chain so your server doesn't have to run blockchain infrastructure.

> **gold-402 note:** For most builders, start with Coinbase CDP. For European deployments, AsterPay is the only MiCA-compliant option. For edge/global scale, Cloudflare.
