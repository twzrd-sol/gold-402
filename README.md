The x402 ecosystem passed 50M transactions in March 2026. 300+ projects across 8 chains. 10,000%+ year-over-year growth. The community awesome-list accepts everything — that's its job.

gold-402 doesn't. Every entry in the README earned its place. The full catalog lives in [`directory/`](directory/).

This is the editorial layer: curated picks with context and badges, backed by an exhaustive reference directory. Two layers, one repo.

## Featured This Month

> ★ **June 2026** — [**Fireblocks Agentic Payments Suite**](https://www.fireblocks.com/products/agentic-payments) by [Fireblocks](https://www.fireblocks.com)

[![24K Featured](https://img.shields.io/badge/24K_Featured-2026--06-C0C0C0?style=plastic)](FEATURED.md)

Fireblocks — the platform behind $14T+ in secured digital asset transactions — launched its Agentic Payments Suite on May 20 and joined the x402 Foundation. The suite covers the full lifecycle of agent-initiated payments: MPC wallet custody with delegation rules, a merchant-side Gateway for stablecoin acceptance alongside existing payment rails, and a security extension contributed to the x402 protocol spec that adds request integrity and spend governance.

This is the controls layer the protocol was missing. Facilitators verify that a payment is valid. Fireblocks verifies that the agent was authorized to make it. That distinction — and the compliance infrastructure (KYT, Travel Rule, audit trails) baked in by default — is what makes agentic payments deployable in regulated enterprise environments. The ecosystem has been developer-first for its first year. This is the moment it became enterprise-ready.

## Quick Start

> **New to x402?** Three steps to your first payment.

**1. Pick a facilitator**

| Use case | Facilitator |
|----------|-------------|
| Most chains, full SDK support | [Coinbase CDP](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402) |
| Edge deployment, global latency | [Cloudflare x402](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/x402) |
| Enterprise billing + disputes | [Stripe Machine Payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/machine/x402) |

**2. Install the SDK**

```bash
# TypeScript
npm install @coinbase/x402-express

# Python
pip install x402

# Rust
cargo add x402
```

**3. Add payment middleware**

```typescript
import { paymentMiddleware } from '@coinbase/x402-express';

app.use(paymentMiddleware(wallet, {
  '/api/data': { price: '$0.01', network: 'base-mainnet' }
}));
```

That's it. The middleware returns 402 with payment details, verifies the client's payment header, and lets the request through.

## How x402 Works

```
1. Client  →  GET /api/data                              (initial request)
2. Server  ←  402 Payment Required                       (payment details in header)
               X-Payment-Required: {amount, address, network}
3. Client  →  EIP-3009 gasless USDC transfer             (client signs + submits)
4. Client  →  GET /api/data  +  X-Payment: {signed tx}  (retry with payment)
5. Facilitator  →  verify + settle on-chain              (~2 seconds)
6. Server  ←  200 OK  +  X-Payment-Response              (resource returned)
```

No gas for the sender. No subscription. No API key. Payment IS authentication.
